QuantumComputingSimulatedAnnealing
==================================

Using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, this program solves the Ising spin glass ground state problem (a combinatorial optimization problem that the D-WAVE One was designed to solve) faster than the D-WAVE One's (the first commercial alleged quantum computer) quantum annealing processor with higher probability of success.
